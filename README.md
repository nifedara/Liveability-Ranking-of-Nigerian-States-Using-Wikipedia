# Liveability-Ranking-of-Nigerian-States-Using-Wikipedia
## Analyzing Wikipedia data using NLP and Machine Learning ##

by **Daramola Oluwanifemi**

### Objectives ###
1. to extract Wikipedia articles about Nigerian locations
2. to do a liveability ranking based on the characteristics of the articles
3. to determine whether Wikipedia articles can be used to estimate the development of regions of the world where the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are hard to track due to a lack of data. 


### Installation ###
1. Pandas - for data cleaning/manipulation
2. spaCy and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) - for text analysis
3. Sklearn - for machine learning
4. TextBlob - for sentiment analysis
5. MatPlotlib - for visualization
6. WordCloud - for Word Cloud visualization
7. Geopandas - for working with geospatial data

### Introduction ###
QUESTION: Where are the worst and most liveable places in Nigeria?
> To answer this question, I carried out this analysis of over 55474 Wikipedia articles that mention Nigeria.

### Project Methodology ###
The approach I used in this analysis to find out the liveability of states in Nigeria by mining Wikipedia is categorized into the following phases;
1. Getting Data - Wikipedia Extraction (XML Parsing)
2. Named Entity Recognition
3. Machine Learning Classification
4. NLP Pre-processing
5. Sentiment Analysis
6. Liveability Scoring and Ranking

### Result & Conclusion ###
From the results, we can make the following deductions:
1. Of the 10 Nigerian states considered, Anambra state is the most liveable state.
2. Akwa-Ibom state is the least liveable state.

There's no previously done Nigerian state liveabilty ranking metric to measure the accuracy of the result of my analysis with, but I believe Wikipedia articles can be used to estimate the development of regions of the world, like Nigeria where the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are hard to track due to a lack of data.


### Dataset ###
The dataset of the Wikipedia articles about Nigeria which I created will be uploaded for access to anyone who is interested in a project like this.
